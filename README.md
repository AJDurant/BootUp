# BootUp
Crowdfunding Application using [web2py](http://www.web2py.com/). This was part of my Individual Assessment for the Interactive Application Programming Techniques module.

This was built for [web2py v2.9.10](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/releases/tag/R-2.9.10) and testing with [v2.9.12](https://github.com/web2py/web2py/releases/tag/R-2.9.12) it did not work.
